# The 5 Laws of LLM-Assisted Work

A manifesto for responsible and effective use of Large Language Models across different professional domains. This project presents a set of guiding principles for working with AI assistants in various fields including coding, healthcare, legal practice, design, education, and general work environments.

## Overview

This project provides a framework of principles to help professionals integrate LLMs into their workflows while maintaining high standards of quality, accountability, and ethical conduct. Each domain has its own specific set of 5 laws, tailored to address the unique challenges and requirements of that field.

## Domains Covered

- **Coding**: Guidelines for developers using LLMs in software development
- **Working**: General principles for LLM integration in professional workflows
- **Design**: Framework for designers leveraging LLMs in creative processes
- **Education**: Guidelines for educators using LLMs in educational contexts
- **Healthcare**: Principles for healthcare professionals using LLMs in medical practice
- **Legal**: Framework for legal professionals integrating LLMs in legal practice

## Core Principles

Each domain's laws are structured around five fundamental principles:

1. **Freedom of LLM Choice**: Flexibility in selecting appropriate AI tools
2. **Context Comprehension and Validation**: Understanding and validating AI outputs
3. **Human-AI Collaboration**: Maintaining human oversight and expertise
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Active feedback and refinement of processes
5. **Ethical Standards**: Adherence to domain-specific ethical guidelines
